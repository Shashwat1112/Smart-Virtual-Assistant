# Smart-Virtual-Assistant
It is designed to perform various tasks that a user might demand, such as opening Google, Facebook, telling the time, and more. The Smart Virtual Assistant also has the capability to interact with the user through voice commands, allowing for a more natural and intuitive user experience.

In terms of implementation, the Smart Virtual Assistant likely makes use of various C++ libraries and APIs to handle the voice recognition and other functionality. It may also incorporate machine learning algorithms to improve its ability to understand and respond to user requests.

To use this Smart Virtual Assistant, a user would likely need to install the necessary software on their device and then activate it using a voice command or other trigger. Once activated, the user can interact with the assistant using natural language commands and receive responses in real-time.

Overall, this project has the potential to provide users with a powerful and convenient tool for managing their daily tasks and activities using voice commands and natural language interactions.

Uses E-speak application for voice output.
